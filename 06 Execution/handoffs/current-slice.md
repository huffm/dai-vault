# current slice

**slice:** cognitive protocol runtime — artifact contract migration (slice 4)
**status:** shipped 2026-05-14
**repos touched:** `dai` (.NET backend, tests); `dai-vault` (this doc, contract doc, sports cognitive worker model, sports flow)

## what shipped

The first runtime-side slice of the Cognitive Protocol Runtime migration. New sports runs persist a canonical `CognitiveProtocol` block alongside the legacy `CognitivePhases`. The persisted `AgentRunExecutionResult` now carries an explicit `ArtifactVersion`.

- canonical contract: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/CognitiveProtocol.cs`
  - records: `CognitiveProtocol`, `PerceiveProtocol`, `InterrogateProtocol`, `DiscernProtocol`, `DecideProtocol`, `SynthesizeProtocol`
  - constants: `ArtifactVersions.SportsDecisionArtifactV2 = "sports_decision_artifact_v2"`
- deterministic builder: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/CognitiveProtocolBuilder.cs`
  - `CognitiveProtocolBuilder.FromLegacy(SportsCognitivePhases?)` produces the canonical shape from the legacy phases at compose time
- compose wiring: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/SportsComposer.cs`
  - success path stamps `ArtifactVersion` and populates `CognitiveProtocol`
  - failure path stamps `ArtifactVersion` and leaves `CognitiveProtocol` null
- read-side projection updated: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/ProtocolVocabularyMapper.cs`
  - prefers persisted `CognitiveProtocol` when present (v2)
  - falls back to legacy `CognitivePhases` when absent (v1)
- DTO surface: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/AgentRunContracts.cs`
  - `AgentRunExecutionResult` gains optional `ArtifactVersion` and `CognitiveProtocol`
  - `AgentRunArtifactDto` surfaces both on `GET /api/agent-runs/{id}/artifact`
- view: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/CognitiveProtocolView.cs`
  - `DiscernStressProtocolView` gains optional `Canonical` slot for canonical-sourced stress
- tests: 24 new tests added (197 total passing)
  - `CognitiveProtocolBuilderTests.cs` covers the legacy → canonical builder rules
  - `ProtocolVocabularyMapperTests.cs` covers canonical-source preference, legacy fallback, and round-trip
  - `SportsComposerTests.cs` covers v2 stamping on success and failure paths and v1 deserialization
  - `AgentRunsControllerTests.cs` covers the artifact endpoint for both v1 and v2 records

## doctrine carried by this slice

- canonical protocol names are now authoritative on persisted artifacts. legacy names remain compatibility aliases only.
- Retrieve is platform plumbing, not a cognitive micro-action.
- `Interrogate.Probe` has no runtime source yet and is null on every v2 record. future slices may populate it.
- `Discern.Stress` is single-source by canonical contract. the builder prefers legacy `interrogate.stress` and falls back to legacy `discern.test` only when the first is null. no concatenation.
- `Decide.Position` preserves the validated posture string exactly. position is decision posture, not a pick.
- `Synthesize` is platform-operational, not simulated cognition.

## transitional compatibility model

The migration is dual-emit. While both shapes are present:

- new runs persist both `CognitivePhases` and `CognitiveProtocol`. They stay semantically aligned because they derive from the same single analyzer call.
- old runs (no `ArtifactVersion`, no `CognitiveProtocol`) continue to deserialize and project through the legacy fallback.
- the artifact inspection endpoint surfaces both shapes plus a `ProtocolView` projection. `ProtocolView` prefers canonical when present.
- the user-facing `AgentRunResultDto` is unchanged. Angular consumers are unaffected.
- there is no database migration, no schema change, no historical row rewrite, no calibration report rewrite.

## artifactVersion semantics

- `null` on `OutputJson` records: treat as v1. Legacy `CognitivePhases` only. Projection uses the legacy fallback path.
- `"sports_decision_artifact_v2"`: canonical `CognitiveProtocol` is present and authoritative. Legacy `CognitivePhases` is present for compatibility.
- the constant lives in `DevCore.Api.AgentRuns.ArtifactVersions.SportsDecisionArtifactV2`.

## what this slice did not touch

- `dai/services/agent-service/` (FastAPI Pydantic models, analyze prompt body, route handler)
- `DevCore.AiClient/SportAnalysisContracts.cs` (the wire contract for `SportsAnalysisResponse.Phases`)
- `SportsRunArtifact`, `SportsAnalyzer`, `SportsEvaluator`, `SportsQualityChecker` (and the pipeline stage order)
- Angular sports app or `/dev/artifacts` page
- database schema and migrations
- calibration reports under `dai-vault/04 Products/sports-v1/calibration/`

## future removal path for CognitivePhases

Removal lands in a later slice after the following:

1. Update the analyze prompt in `sports_analyzer.py` so the model emits canonical micro-action names directly.
2. Rename the FastAPI Pydantic models in `app/models/sports.py` and the .NET `SportsCognitivePhases` records in `DevCore.AiClient/SportAnalysisContracts.cs` in lockstep.
3. Adjust `SportsQualityChecker` rules that read legacy field-derived `CounterCase` / `WatchFor` to read canonical sources.
4. Confirm historical v1 records have either been migrated or aged out for the relevant calibration windows.
5. Drop `CognitivePhases` from `AgentRunExecutionResult` and the contract docs.

Until then, `CognitiveProtocol` is the authoritative source and `CognitivePhases` is a compatibility alias.

## next slice candidates

- Phase B continuation: dual-emit prompt update — teach the analyze prompt to emit canonical field names without removing legacy ones. Requires FastAPI + .NET lockstep.
- Probe runtime source: surface `SignalFollowUpRecord[]` into `Interrogate.Probe` so the canonical Probe is non-null when the platform has investigation candidates.
- Quality check migration: update `SportsQualityChecker` to read canonical sources for `CounterCase` / `WatchFor` derivation before the legacy fields are removed.

## addendum: dev artifact surface (2026-05-14)

`/dev/artifacts` in `apps/sports-app` now renders the canonical Cognitive Protocol Runtime output in a new "Cognitive Protocol" section. The page:

- Shows an Artifact Version stat in the Run Overview. `v2 sports_decision_artifact` for new runs, `v1 (legacy)` for older runs.
- Prefers persisted `cognitiveProtocol` when present (v2 records).
- Falls back to the per-request `protocolView` projection when only the projection is available (v1 records).
- Displays "Not recorded" on every micro-action when both shapes are absent.
- Shows a source badge — "Canonical Artifact", "View Projection", or "Not Recorded" — so reviewers know which path produced the rendered block.
- Renders the five canonical cards: Perceive, Interrogate, Discern, Decide, Synthesize.
- For Discern.Stress: renders a single "Canonical Stress" row when canonical, or two labeled rows ("Legacy Interrogate Stress", "Legacy Discern Test") for v1 records. No concatenation.
- Leaves the legacy "Cognitive Phases" section in place as a labeled compatibility view.
- Does not change the customer-facing Matchup Analyzer output.

Backend, FastAPI, and database are unchanged in this surface slice. Only the dev review page and its TypeScript types were touched.

Affected files:

- `dai/apps/sports-app/src/app/core/models/agent-run.model.ts` — new TS types: `CognitiveProtocolDto`, `CognitiveProtocolViewDto`, plus nested per-protocol types; `AgentRunArtifactDto` gains optional `artifactVersion`, `cognitiveProtocol`, `protocolView`.
- `dai/apps/sports-app/src/app/dev-artifact-review/dev-artifact-review.component.ts` — view-model builder (`protocolBlocks`), source resolution logic, multi-source Stress handling, artifact version label.
- `dai/apps/sports-app/src/app/dev-artifact-review/dev-artifact-review.component.html` — Artifact Version stat in Run Overview; new Cognitive Protocol section with source badge.
