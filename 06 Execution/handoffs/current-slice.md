# current slice

**slice:** cognitive protocol runtime — artifact contract migration (slice 4)
**status:** shipped 2026-05-14
**repos touched:** `dai` (.NET backend, tests); `dai-vault` (this doc, contract doc, sports cognitive worker model, sports flow)

## what shipped

The first runtime-side slice of the Cognitive Protocol Runtime migration. New sports runs persist a canonical `CognitiveProtocol` block alongside the legacy `CognitivePhases`. The persisted `AgentRunExecutionResult` now carries an explicit `ArtifactVersion`.

- canonical contract: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/CognitiveProtocol.cs`
  - records: `CognitiveProtocol`, `PerceiveProtocol`, `InterrogateProtocol`, `DiscernProtocol`, `DecideProtocol`, `SynthesizeProtocol`
  - constants: `ArtifactVersions.SportsDecisionArtifactV2 = "sports_decision_artifact_v2"`
- deterministic builder: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/CognitiveProtocolBuilder.cs`
  - `CognitiveProtocolBuilder.FromLegacy(SportsCognitivePhases?)` produces the canonical shape from the legacy phases at compose time
- compose wiring: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/SportsComposer.cs`
  - success path stamps `ArtifactVersion` and populates `CognitiveProtocol`
  - failure path stamps `ArtifactVersion` and leaves `CognitiveProtocol` null
- read-side projection updated: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/ProtocolVocabularyMapper.cs`
  - prefers persisted `CognitiveProtocol` when present (v2)
  - falls back to legacy `CognitivePhases` when absent (v1)
- DTO surface: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/AgentRunContracts.cs`
  - `AgentRunExecutionResult` gains optional `ArtifactVersion` and `CognitiveProtocol`
  - `AgentRunArtifactDto` surfaces both on `GET /api/agent-runs/{id}/artifact`
- view: `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/AgentRuns/CognitiveProtocolView.cs`
  - `DiscernStressProtocolView` gains optional `Canonical` slot for canonical-sourced stress
- tests: 24 new tests added (197 total passing)
  - `CognitiveProtocolBuilderTests.cs` covers the legacy → canonical builder rules
  - `ProtocolVocabularyMapperTests.cs` covers canonical-source preference, legacy fallback, and round-trip
  - `SportsComposerTests.cs` covers v2 stamping on success and failure paths and v1 deserialization
  - `AgentRunsControllerTests.cs` covers the artifact endpoint for both v1 and v2 records

## doctrine carried by this slice

- canonical protocol names are now authoritative on persisted artifacts. legacy names remain compatibility aliases only.
- Retrieve is platform plumbing, not a cognitive micro-action.
- `Interrogate.Probe` has no runtime source yet and is null on every v2 record. future slices may populate it.
- `Discern.Stress` is single-source by canonical contract. the builder prefers legacy `interrogate.stress` and falls back to legacy `discern.test` only when the first is null. no concatenation.
- `Decide.Position` preserves the validated posture string exactly. position is decision posture, not a pick.
- `Synthesize` is platform-operational, not simulated cognition.

## transitional compatibility model

The migration is dual-emit. While both shapes are present:

- new runs persist both `CognitivePhases` and `CognitiveProtocol`. They stay semantically aligned because they derive from the same single analyzer call.
- old runs (no `ArtifactVersion`, no `CognitiveProtocol`) continue to deserialize and project through the legacy fallback.
- the artifact inspection endpoint surfaces both shapes plus a `ProtocolView` projection. `ProtocolView` prefers canonical when present.
- the user-facing `AgentRunResultDto` is unchanged. Angular consumers are unaffected.
- there is no database migration, no schema change, no historical row rewrite, no calibration report rewrite.

## artifactVersion semantics

- `null` on `OutputJson` records: treat as v1. Legacy `CognitivePhases` only. Projection uses the legacy fallback path.
- `"sports_decision_artifact_v2"`: canonical `CognitiveProtocol` is present and authoritative. Legacy `CognitivePhases` is present for compatibility.
- the constant lives in `DevCore.Api.AgentRuns.ArtifactVersions.SportsDecisionArtifactV2`.

## what this slice did not touch

- `dai/services/agent-service/` (FastAPI Pydantic models, analyze prompt body, route handler)
- `DevCore.AiClient/SportAnalysisContracts.cs` (the wire contract for `SportsAnalysisResponse.Phases`)
- `SportsRunArtifact`, `SportsAnalyzer`, `SportsEvaluator`, `SportsQualityChecker` (and the pipeline stage order)
- Angular sports app or `/dev/artifacts` page
- database schema and migrations
- calibration reports under `dai-vault/04 Products/sports-v1/calibration/`

## future removal path for CognitivePhases

Removal lands in a later slice after the following:

1. Update the analyze prompt in `sports_analyzer.py` so the model emits canonical micro-action names directly.
2. Rename the FastAPI Pydantic models in `app/models/sports.py` and the .NET `SportsCognitivePhases` records in `DevCore.AiClient/SportAnalysisContracts.cs` in lockstep.
3. Adjust `SportsQualityChecker` rules that read legacy field-derived `CounterCase` / `WatchFor` to read canonical sources.
4. Confirm historical v1 records have either been migrated or aged out for the relevant calibration windows.
5. Drop `CognitivePhases` from `AgentRunExecutionResult` and the contract docs.

Until then, `CognitiveProtocol` is the authoritative source and `CognitivePhases` is a compatibility alias.

## next slice candidates

- Phase B continuation: dual-emit prompt update — teach the analyze prompt to emit canonical field names without removing legacy ones. Requires FastAPI + .NET lockstep.
- Probe runtime source: surface `SignalFollowUpRecord[]` into `Interrogate.Probe` so the canonical Probe is non-null when the platform has investigation candidates.
- Quality check migration: update `SportsQualityChecker` to read canonical sources for `CounterCase` / `WatchFor` derivation before the legacy fields are removed.

## addendum: Probe Population v1 (2026-05-14)

`Interrogate.Probe` is now populated deterministically at compose time from existing signal follow-up data. No LLM call. No FastAPI change. No prompt change. No database migration.

- new overload: `CognitiveProtocolBuilder.FromLegacy(SportsCognitivePhases?, SignalFollowUpRecord[]?)`. The single-arg overload (`FromLegacy(phases)`) is preserved and keeps Probe null.
- new helper: `CognitiveProtocolBuilder.BuildProbe(SignalFollowUpRecord[]?)` is the pure deterministic probe builder.
- `SportsComposer.Compose` calls the two-arg overload with `retrieval.SignalFollowUps`.
- failure path unchanged: `ComposeFailedRun` keeps `CognitiveProtocol` null, so Probe stays null on failure.

### gap detection

A follow-up record marks a missing primary when any of the following holds:

- `Reason == "primary_signal_missing"` -> `Signal` is the missing primary
- `DecisionUse == "missing_confirmation"` -> `Signal` is the missing primary
- `FallbackType == "lateral_proxy"` -> `TriggeredBy` is the missing primary (the proxy is filling for it)

Missing primaries are deduplicated and ordered by `StringComparer.Ordinal`.

### doctrinal probe templates

| missing signal | probe sentence |
|---|---|
| `sharp_public` | Sharp/public signal missing; market read relies on price movement only. |
| `market` | Market signal missing; directional read should rely on schedule and situational context. |
| `rest_schedule` | Rest edge is unclear; schedule signal should be treated as neutral. |
| `starting_pitching` | Starting pitching unavailable; lean should not depend on starter advantage. |

Signals without a template are silently dropped so the probe never fabricates injury, form, travel, or unsupported claims. `line_movement` is deliberately excluded because it is permanently `not_implemented` and would add noise on every run.

### dev artifact surface impact

`/dev/artifacts` already pass-through `cognitiveProtocol.interrogate.probe` from the artifact endpoint, so Probe now renders as a one or two sentence summary on v2 runs with real gaps and as "Not recorded" otherwise. No Angular change was needed.

## addendum: dev artifact surface (2026-05-14)

`/dev/artifacts` in `apps/sports-app` now renders the canonical Cognitive Protocol Runtime output in a new "Cognitive Protocol" section. The page:

- Shows an Artifact Version stat in the Run Overview. `v2 sports_decision_artifact` for new runs, `v1 (legacy)` for older runs.
- Prefers persisted `cognitiveProtocol` when present (v2 records).
- Falls back to the per-request `protocolView` projection when only the projection is available (v1 records).
- Displays "Not recorded" on every micro-action when both shapes are absent.
- Shows a source badge — "Canonical Artifact", "View Projection", or "Not Recorded" — so reviewers know which path produced the rendered block.
- Renders the five canonical cards: Perceive, Interrogate, Discern, Decide, Synthesize.
- For Discern.Stress: renders a single "Canonical Stress" row when canonical, or two labeled rows ("Legacy Interrogate Stress", "Legacy Discern Test") for v1 records. No concatenation.
- Leaves the legacy "Cognitive Phases" section in place as a labeled compatibility view.
- Does not change the customer-facing Matchup Analyzer output.

Backend, FastAPI, and database are unchanged in this surface slice. Only the dev review page and its TypeScript types were touched.

Affected files:

- `dai/apps/sports-app/src/app/core/models/agent-run.model.ts` — new TS types: `CognitiveProtocolDto`, `CognitiveProtocolViewDto`, plus nested per-protocol types; `AgentRunArtifactDto` gains optional `artifactVersion`, `cognitiveProtocol`, `protocolView`.
- `dai/apps/sports-app/src/app/dev-artifact-review/dev-artifact-review.component.ts` — view-model builder (`protocolBlocks`), source resolution logic, multi-source Stress handling, artifact version label.
- `dai/apps/sports-app/src/app/dev-artifact-review/dev-artifact-review.component.html` — Artifact Version stat in Run Overview; new Cognitive Protocol section with source badge.

## addendum: Outcome Reconciliation Harness v1 (2026-05-18)

Dev tooling to reconcile the 2026-05-18 cognitive protocol calibration batch against actual game outcomes once the games complete (~2026-05-20). No runtime code, no confidence rule, no analyzer or FastAPI change. It consumes only existing endpoints.

- new script: `dai/scripts/dev/sports/reconcile-calibration-outcomes.ps1`
  - reads the committed export csv plus a game-results input csv, matches by `run_id`
  - for each game marked `final` it posts to `POST /api/agent-runs/{id}/outcome`, then reads back `GET /api/agent-runs/{id}/evaluation` (the platform's directional eval)
  - writes a reconciled csv (only the 7 outcome columns filled) and a markdown reconciliation note; never overwrites the original export
  - `-DryRun` posts nothing and requires no running stack
  - cover / total result are filled only when `closing_spread_home` / `closing_total` are supplied in the results input; left blank otherwise — never guessed
- new template: `dai-vault/04 Products/sports-v1/calibration/protocol-runs/2026-05-18-game-results-input.csv`
  - pre-seeded with the 8 batch run ids, all `game_status = pending`
- outputs (same protocol-runs folder):
  - `2026-05-18-cognitive-protocol-run-export-reconciled.csv`
  - `2026-05-18-cognitive-protocol-outcome-reconciliation.md`

status: harness built and dry-run verified 2026-05-18 (8 runs, 0 completed, 8 pending; final-game derivation self-tested with synthetic scores). live reconciliation runs after 2026-05-20 once NBA (05-18, 05-19) and MLB (05-18) games are final and the results input is filled with actual scores. confidence calibration remains blocked on this reconciliation evidence — see the calibration export note.

## addendum: Cognitive Protocol Node Specs v1 (2026-05-18)

Doctrine slice. Vault docs only — no runtime code touched.

- new doc: `dai-vault/02 Platform/architecture/cognitive-factory/protocol-node-specs.md`
  - operational node spec for all 15 cognitive nodes (Perceive/Interrogate/Discern/Decide + Synthesize, three micro-actions each)
  - each node defines 11 facets: purpose, fields read, fields written, allowed tools, allowed scripts/reflexes, model-call rule, signal dependencies, quality checks, fallback, sports overlay, forbidden behavior
  - sits below `cognitive-protocol-runtime.md` (names the nodes) and `protocol-vocabulary-map.md` (legacy↔canonical) as the contract a future code slice implements against
- doctrine reinforced by this doc:
  - Retrieve is platform plumbing, not a node; Perceive consumes retrieval output
  - Probe is deterministic (`CognitiveProtocolBuilder.BuildProbe` from `SignalFollowUpRecord[]`), no model call
  - the Synthesize trio is deterministic (`SportsComposer`), no model call
  - models never choose their own tools, write scope, or data access — fields and tools are fixed per node
  - confidence value and band are deterministic (`SportsEvaluator`); the model owns rationale text, not numbers or the posture enum
- open question carried forward: NCAAW (women's college basketball) is not a platform competition — no `CompetitionCatalog` entry, no teams, no retriever — so no node overlay exists for it. Decide whether to add the competition or drop it from cognitive scope.

status: node specs defined 2026-05-18. they give the stable target that the Phase B canonical prompt/contract rename was waiting on.

## addendum: Cloud and Tool Runtime Plan (2026-05-20)

Doctrine slice. Vault docs only. No runtime code, no FastAPI change, no database change, no Angular change.

- new doc: `dai-vault/02 Platform/architecture/cloud-tool-runtime-plan.md`
  - launch-friendly cloud target: Azure Container Apps for the .NET orchestrator and the FastAPI analyzer; Azure SQL as system of record; Static Web Apps for the Angular client; Key Vault for secrets; Application Insights for telemetry; Entra External ID for customer identity
  - explicit launch exclusions: AKS, multi-region, brokers, API Management, pgvector as primary store, MCP on the synchronous run path
  - DAI Tool Gateway named as the authority over every tool call, retriever call, FastAPI call, future MCP call, and future Azure Function invocation. Lives in `DevCore.Api` and wraps existing typed HttpClients first, then accumulates.
  - Tool Registry v1 shape: static manifest in code with `tool_id`, `kind`, `transport`, `handler`, `allowed_protocol_nodes`, `secrets_scope`, `idempotency`, `cache_ttl`, `cost_class`, `tenant_tier_minimum`, `calibration_hooks`. Designed so a database-backed dynamic registry can be added later without rewriting the gateway interface.
  - Azure Functions positioned for bounded reflex jobs and scheduled or event-driven tools only, never on the synchronous run path
  - pgvector positioned as additive memory and search, not a primary store replacement, with `allowed_protocol_nodes` initially empty for synchronous use and first realistic opening at Interrogate.Probe
  - MCP positioned as a future transport value in the registry, not the core runtime; the gateway hides the transport from protocol nodes
  - AKS positioned as future infrastructure, only when Container Apps proves insufficient
- doctrine reinforced by this doc:
  - the runtime tells you what cognition is allowed; this doc tells you what infrastructure cognition runs on and what governs the tools cognition is allowed to invoke
  - .NET keeps orchestration, retrieval, evaluation, synthesis, identity, and now the Tool Gateway; FastAPI stays narrow on the analyze model call only
  - models never choose tools; the gateway, not the model, decides what a node may invoke (consistent with `protocol-node-specs.md`)
- recommended next slices (sequenced):
  1. tool gateway skeleton in .NET wrapping `OddsScheduleClient.GetEventsAsync` only
  2. wrap remaining typed clients (`OddsMarketClient`, `EspnBasketballScheduleClient`, `MlbStarterClient`) and the FastAPI analyze call behind the gateway
  3. container apps deploy slice: package both services, internal DNS, Key Vault, App Insights, smoke parity with `test-sports-dev.ps1`
  4. pgvector memory landing for calibration corpora, offline first, no synchronous run dependency
  5. first azure function tool: outcome reconciliation timer, re-hosting `reconcile-calibration-outcomes.ps1`
  6. probe enrichment via gateway, behind a per-tenant flag, as the first real opening of `allowed_protocol_nodes` for a non-typed-client tool
- open questions carried forward:
  - does payment-tier enforcement on tool calls land before or after the first paying customer? Registry has the field; enforcement turns on after Stripe webhook truth is wired through.
  - which competition gets the first pgvector-backed Probe enrichment? candidates are NBA (mature signal set) or MLB (single-signal runs benefit most from prior-run lookups).
  - region selection at launch.

status: plan written 2026-05-20. it gives the stable launch target the Phase B prompt/contract rename and the first Tool Gateway slice can be planned against without ambiguity.

## addendum: Tool Gateway Wire-In v1 (2026-05-20)

Runtime slice. Wires the skeleton into DI and migrates one safe call site. No FastAPI change, no DB schema change, no customer-facing output change.

- new code (`dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/Tools/`):
  - `ToolGatewayServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` — `AddDaiToolGateway(IServiceCollection)` extension. Registers `IToolRegistry` (singleton, `ToolRegistry.Default()`), `IToolGateway` (scoped), and `IToolHandler<ScheduleMatchupDatesInput, MatchupEventDto[]>` as `AddKeyedScoped` keyed by `ToolIds.ScheduleMatchupDates`. Scoped lifetimes match `AddHttpClient<OddsScheduleClient>`'s transient-with-managed-handler so the gateway can resolve handlers per request without holding HTTP message handlers alive.
- modified code:
  - `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/Program.cs` — adds `using DevCore.Api.Tools;` and one line: `builder.Services.AddDaiToolGateway();` after the existing pipeline registrations.
  - `dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api/Controllers/SportsReferenceController.cs` — constructor now also injects `IToolGateway` alongside the existing `OddsScheduleClient` and `AppDbContext`. The `GetMatchupDates` action invokes the gateway with `ProtocolNode = ProtocolNodes.PlatformReference`, `CorrelationId = HttpContext.TraceIdentifier`, `RunId = null`, `TenantKey = null`. `GetUpcoming` is unchanged — it still calls `OddsScheduleClient.GetAllUpcomingEventsAsync` directly because that method is not wrapped by the v1 registry.
- new tests (`dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api.Tests/Tools/ToolGatewayDIRegistrationTests.cs`):
  - `resolve_tool_gateway_from_application_services` — resolves `IToolGateway` from the real `Program.cs` service graph and asserts it is a `ToolGateway`.
  - `resolve_tool_registry_with_default_manifest_containing_schedule_matchup_dates` — asserts the v1 manifest entry is present with the expected kind, transport, and allowed caller.
  - `resolve_schedule_matchup_dates_handler_as_keyed_service` — asserts the keyed handler resolves to `ScheduleMatchupDatesHandler`.
- new tests (`dai/platform/dotnet/DevCore.Api.Tests/Integration/SportsReferenceControllerTests.cs`):
  - `matchup_dates_returns_not_found_for_unknown_competition_code` — 404 path still fires before the gateway is reached.
  - `matchup_dates_returns_bad_request_when_team_is_missing` — 400 path still fires before the gateway is reached.
  - `matchup_dates_returns_ok_with_empty_array_via_tool_gateway_when_provider_unavailable` — the gateway-routed happy path returns the same JSON array shape; team seeding added to `InitializeAsync` so the controller's team-existence check passes.
- behavior compatibility: the API response for `GET /api/competitions/{code}/matchup-dates` is byte-identical at the JSON-array level. Same content type, same status codes for the unchanged validation branches, same empty-on-degraded behavior when `OddsApi:ApiKey` is unset. Existing `SportsReferenceController` callers, the Angular sports app, and `/dev/artifacts` consumers see no contract change.
- what stayed deferred: correlation header injection into outbound HTTP from the gateway, idempotency caching, cost-class enforcement, tenant-tier enforcement, swapping the retrieval-side call sites (`OddsMarketClient`, `EspnBasketballScheduleClient`, `MlbStarterClient`, `FastApiClient`), wiring into the main sports analysis pipeline, Azure Container Apps deploy, pgvector landing, Azure Functions, MCP adapters.
- next safe slice: wrap the next typed client behind the gateway. Recommended order: `OddsMarketClient.GetFootballSpreadAsync` and `GetBasketballSpreadAsync` (retrieve-stage callers, `ProtocolNodes.PlatformRetrieve`). That slice opens `platform.retrieve` to the manifest, exercises the same wrap-in-handler pattern, and stays inside `dai/platform/dotnet/` with no FastAPI or DB changes.

status: wire-in merged 2026-05-20. tests: 216 passed, 0 failed (was 210, +6).
